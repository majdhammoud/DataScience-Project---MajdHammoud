### **Overview**

This project analyzes Airbnb listings data to uncover insights on pricing, room types, reviews, and neighborhood performance. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly), it explores how host behavior and listing features influence success on Airbnb.

## **Objectives**

  1. Identify which neighborhoods and room types dominate the market

  2. Examine price variations across areas

  3. Explore review activity and guest engagement

  4. Analyze correlations between price, reviews, and availability

## **Tools Used**

Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Environment:  Google Colab

## **Project Steps**

  1. Data Cleaning – Handled missing values and standardized columns

  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Generated descriptive statistics and correlations

  3. Visualizations – Created bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps

  4. Interactive Dashboard – Built using Plotly for dynamic insights

## **Key Insights**

  1. Entire homes/apartments have the highest prices and demand

  2. Manhattan dominates in listing count

  3. Listings with frequent reviews attract more guests

  4. Prices show weak correlation with review frequency

  5. A few hosts manage a large number of listings

## **Recommendations**

1. Optimize pricing based on neighborhood and room type

2. Encourage hosts to maintain higher engagement and faster responses

3. Focus marketing on top-performing areas
